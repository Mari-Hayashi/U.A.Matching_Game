U.A. Matching Game

This game is built using Unity, a cross-platform game engine. I developed this game using C++, which I learned through my coursework at UCR. I also draw all drawings in the game.
 
In this game, a player clicks to flip the cards and tries to delete it by matching it with another, like Concentration. When the player erases certain number of cards, the characters use their quirks (or special ability) to help the player. This is a fan game of Japanese Anime called My Hero Academia.
